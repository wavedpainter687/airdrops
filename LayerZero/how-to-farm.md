# Brief Summary

In order to "farm" $ZRO, you will need to participate in the LayerZero ecosystem in someway or form. The distribution of the tokens is ultimately based on the team, so we won't know the criteria chosen until its too late. So, in order to maximize your chances of receiving an airdrop, "farm" different areas of the LayerZero network. 

# Purpose

The purpose of this document is to show how to do some basic tasks in order to qualify for the potential airdrop


# Use Multiple bridges powered by LayerZero

Startgate (STG) seems to be a largest protocol using LayerZero
1) Buy $STG (Preferably $500+)
2) Go to https://stargate.finance/transfer using your ETH network
3) Transfer 30 $STG to ARB network
4) Stake 27 $STG and vote in snapshot proposal

Note: The more STG you stake the more your chances of receiving an airdrop...
ProTip - Using $STG to bridge to other-chains has lower gas needs 

# Interact with some of the mainnet apps 

## Holograph omni-chain NFT minting site

1) Go to https://app.holograph.xyz/
2) Mint some NFT's on the Polygon/Avalanche chain and bridge to Ethereum (This bridging utilizes the layerzero protocol)

ProTip - Have enough gas on the new chain that your bridging towards

## $SUSHI/$JOE/$CAKE exchanges 

1) Go to anyone of the above exchanges and "cross-swap" an asset from one chain to another
2) Use mainly "less-expensive" chains like BNB/AVAX for this
   
ProTip - Using ETH will result in high gas fees, if you don't want to waste money but still want to show activity use other chains

## Keep Track of Amount of TX's

1) Use https://dune.com/kosk/stargate-amount-of-tx/ to keep track of your wallets transactions using LayerZero

## Hold OG ONfts

1) Buy and hold "Gh0stly Gh0sts" as the first ONFT deployed with LayerZero Integration

## Get all discord roles via guild for stargate

1) https://guild.xyz/stargate

## Criterias to concentrate for maximizing airdrop potential

1) Number of Transactions
2) Total Volume of Transactions
3) Timeline of Transactions
4) Activity of Wallet 
5) Multi-Chain Bridging
