Best to keep a track of what they are doing

## Use Dune

Using Dune will help provide you with data of your activity for "farming"

## Avod Sybil

Don't get rekt trying to use multiple wallets in order to "farm" for airdrops since the project may disqualify you based on your wallet history and its connection to multiple eligible airdrop wallets. You need to make sure that there are a good amount of organic transactions on your wallet!

## Use SpillWays

1) If you wanna try to farm with multiple wallets, use SpillWays.
2) This is similar to tornado cash
3) Twitter: https://twitter.com/spillways10
