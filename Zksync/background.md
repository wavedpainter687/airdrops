# Background Summary
zkSync is a L2 roll-up scaling solution for ETH. It has been confirmed to have an airdrop of tokens sometime next year, in order to maximize the benefit of this airdrop one should consider starting to use the zkSync Era Mainnet.

Bullish Points:
- ZkSync raised a total of $458 Million 
- There is time to "farm"

Bearish Points(at the moment of this writing):
- Not many dApps "live on Era" 
- Not much volume on the network
