# General recommendations for "Farming"

1) Use liquidity that your willing to lose and never see again. The network can go to shit and you'll never see your money again. Keep this in mind!!!
2) Diversify your transactions, so that you don't seem like a bot. I'm sure when the airdrop will happen, the team will try to remove any wallet they suspect of being a bot.
3) Enjoy using the network...It could be the next "BIG" thing and your one of the first people using it :)
   
# ZKSync Era recommendations

1) Start looking at the following Defi Projects that are live/will go live on the mainnet soon and hold their tokens:
* ZigZag : $ZZ
* Mute   : $MUTE

2) Add a bit of liquidity to some coins like $USDC/$MUTE/$ZZ 

3) Ensure that your active on the network regularly as that may be one of the criteria of the airdrop eligibility

4) Copy the following wallets for their activities as they claimed significant amount of airdrop tokens from different projects:
   - 0x6f9BB7e454f5B3eb2310343f0E99269dC2BB8A1d
