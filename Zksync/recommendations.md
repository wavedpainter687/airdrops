# General recommendations for "Farming"
1) Use liquidity that your willing to lose and never see again. The network can go to shit and you'll never see your money again. Keep this in mind!!!
2) Diversify your transactions, so that you don't seem like a bot. I'm sure when the airdrop will happen, the team will try to remove any wallet they suspect of being a bot.
3) Enjoy using the network...It could be the next "BIG" thing and your one of the first people using it :)

1) ZigZag : $ZZ
2) Mute   : $MUTE

* Add a bit of liquidity to some coins like $MUTE/$ZZ
